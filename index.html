                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that
                makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is
                a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a
                markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers
                the style and structure of a document. HTML is very simple to
                learn and use.

                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for
                describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours,
                layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the
                users. CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is
                independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup
                language. CSS is popularly called the design language of the
                web.

                JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows
                you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a
                web page does more than just sit there and display static
                information for you to look at — displaying timely content
                updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling
                video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably
                involved. It is the third of the web trio.

                React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and
                interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It
                is an open-source, component-based, front-end library
                responsible only for the application’s view layer. In Model View
                Controller (MVC) architecture, the view layer is responsible for
                how the app looks and feels. React was created by Jordan Walke,
                a software engineer at Facebook.
